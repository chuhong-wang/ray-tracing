Math 
 - anti-aliasing (random sampling neighbor pixels)
 - reflection and refraction
  - snell's law
  - total internal refraction (TIR) 
  - Fresnel equation to calculate refraction and transmisson 
 - if a vector pass through a bounding box

architecture 
 - abstract class: hittable, material
 - BVH 
  - shared_ptr to object -> calling different hit(...) functions
