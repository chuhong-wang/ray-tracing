## Introduction 
This is an educational project for learning ray tracing, and eventually create my own visualization platform for molecules and materials. It is a physics-based renderer implemented in C++ and CUDA for high-resolution images written from scratch. I documented the math as well as the program architecture that are vital to understanding the work mechanism. 

## Features 

The features implemented so far:
 - Surface materials (diffuse, metal, transparent)
 - Anti-alising 
 - Depth of Field (defocus blur)
 - Motion Blur 
 - Spatial acceleration algorithm (BVH)

Work In Progress 
 - Multi-thread rendering with CUDA 
 - Texture mapping
